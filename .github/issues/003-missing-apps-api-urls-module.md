# Issue #003: ModuleNotFoundError - Missing apps.api.urls Module

## Issue Description
Django migration command failed with the following error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apps.api.urls'
```

The error occurred when running `python manage.py migrate` command.

## Error Details
- **Command**: `python manage.py migrate`
- **Location**: `config/urls.py` line 9
- **Missing module**: `apps.api.urls`
- **Root Cause**: Referenced URL module that doesn't exist

## Error Context
The error occurred during Django's URL pattern resolution when the system tried to:
1. Import `apps.api.urls` from `config/urls.py`
2. The `apps/api/urls.py` file did not exist
3. This caused the entire URL configuration to fail
4. Migration command couldn't proceed due to URL resolution errors

## Root Cause Analysis
The Django project structure referenced URL patterns in `apps.api.urls` but the actual file was missing:

**Configuration Issue:**
```python
# config/urls.py line 9
path('api/v1/', include('apps.api.urls')),  # Module doesn't exist
```

**Missing File:**
- `/apps/api/urls.py` - Required for URL inclusion

## Resolution Steps Applied
1. **Created missing URL configuration file** at `apps/api/urls.py`
2. **Added basic API endpoints**:
   - Health check endpoint (`/health/`)
   - API documentation endpoint (`/docs/`)
   - Root API endpoint with version info

3. **Implementation details**:
   ```python
   # apps/api/urls.py
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views
   
   urlpatterns = [
       path('health/', views.health_check, name='health_check'),
       path('docs/', views.api_docs, name='api_docs'),
       path('', views.api_root, name='api_root'),
   ]
   ```

## Files Created
- `/apps/api/urls.py` - API URL configuration
- `/apps/api/views.py` - Basic API views (if needed)

## Impact
- **Before**: Migration commands failed completely
- **After**: Django can resolve URL patterns and run migrations
- **Side effect**: Basic API structure now available

## Prevention Strategies
1. **Project scaffolding**: Ensure all referenced modules exist during initial setup
2. **URL validation**: Test URL imports before referencing them
3. **Development checklist**: Verify all `include()` statements have corresponding files
4. **CI/CD checks**: Add URL pattern validation to deployment pipeline

## Technical Notes
- This is a common issue when setting up Django projects with modular URL structure
- Django requires all URL modules to exist even if they're empty
- The error can cascade through multiple Django subsystems (migrations, admin, debug toolbar)
- URL resolution happens during Django startup, making this a blocking error

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - API URLs module created, migrations can now proceed
